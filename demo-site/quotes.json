  "It was many and many a year ago,\nIn a kingdom by the sea",
  "That a maiden there lived whom you may know\nBy the name of Annabel Lee;",
  "And this maiden she lived with no other thought\nThan to love and be loved by me.",
  "But we loved with a love that was more than love—\nI and my Annabel Lee—",
  "With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven\nCoveted her and me.",
  "And this was the reason that, long ago,\nIn this kingdom by the sea,",
  "A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\nMy beautiful Annabel Lee;",
  "So that her highborn kinsmen came\nAnd bore her away from me",
  "To shut her up in a sepulchre\nIn this kingdom by the sea.",
  "The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,\nWent envying her and me—",
  "Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,\nIn this kingdom by the sea)",
  "That the wind came out of the cloud by night,\nChilling and killing my Annabel Lee.",
  "But our love it was stronger by far than the love\nOf those who were older than we—\nOf many far wiser than we—",
  "And neither the angels in Heaven above\nNor the demons down under the sea",
  "Can ever dissever my soul from the soul\nOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;",
  "For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams\nOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;",
  "And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes\nOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;",
  "And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\nOf my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,",
  "In her sepulchre there by the sea—\nIn her tomb by the sounding sea."
